  How-To guide for building the Tetra PAPRa fan box (June 2022 version).
aliases:

  - /1.0/fan-box
---

== Quick Synopsis ==

The Tetra Powered Air Purified Respirator requires that the air be purified; this purification is accomplished by powering a fan to pull air through a filter and then pushing that purified air through a hose to a mask worn on the face.  This section contains the instructions for building the box that holds the fan and filter.

The main goal of this iteration of the fan box is to reach N99 filtration levels by ensuring that the power connector is dustproof and using an IP68-rated BNC jack. 

*WARNING:* we provide no warranty, implicit or explicit, that this device will work up to an N95 specification, when built outside of a facility rated to do so.  The only way to truly test one of these devices using something like a https://tsi.com/products/respirator-fit-testers/portacount-respirator-fit-tester-8038/[Portacount] under controlled conditions.

This particular version of the PAPRA has been tested to pass at an N99 level, and likely passes at an N100/P100 level, since the build uses P100 filters.  We do not have the equipment necessary to validate that this device passes at a P100 level.


== Parts Required ==

== Gaskets ==

Gaskets should be cut from 2mm craft foam.  Ideally, they should be cut by something such as Cricut (https://www.cricut.com/), but can also be cut using scissors or an Xacto knife so long as the templates are followed closely.  The Cricut uses the supplied SVG files, and other cutters can use the supplied DXFs.

== Build Steps ==

=== BNC Connection ===

A video on how to build the BNC connector:

{{< embed-video "https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-8tQGqNz/0/9ee8f740/1280/00002-1280.mp4" "BNC-construction" >}}

Strip the red wire on the fan:

Connect the smaller brass component to the red wire:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-6hqN6Gw/0/4a281751/L/_DSC4242-L.jpg[]

Crimp the brass component to the wire:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-h9NHgCp/0/d5a9558c/L/_DSC4261-L.jpg[]

Test that the crimp went well by tugging on the brass component:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-VQjzFRx/0/22aa36a1/L/_DSC4263-L.jpg[]

Make sure to put the wires through the ground cylinder *before* connecting the brass component to the connector:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-Qthqqct/0/851e31bf/L/_DSC4248-L.jpg[]

Push the brass component into the center of the connector.  

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-bWmGp7t/0/780ad05e/L/_DSC4264-L.jpg[]

Since the wire is braided, this step can be tricky, and a small item like a paperclip can help push the component into the middle of the connector:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-nWbcL9F/0/b58ae059/L/_DSC4268-L.jpg[]

Check that the brass component is visible and flush with the interior plastic column in the connector:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-63w4w3R/0/b88c78a8/L/_DSC4270-L.jpg[]

Tugging on the wire should not have the component pull out:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-vWpwP4h/0/4e030480/L/_DSC4266-L.jpg[]

Strip the black wire:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/Tetra-Testing/29-Aug-2021-Build-Party/i-838DvkG/0/fb37970a/L/_DSC4275-L.jpg[]

=== Congratulations! ===

Congratulations!  You've now built a Tetra PAPRa Fan Box!

== Questions ==

=== How frequently should I change the filter? ===

Changing the filter depends on how much you use the device.  If you're using the device where there are a lot of particulates in the air (such as a construction site or a woodshop), you may want to change every month or so.  If you're using the device where there are less particulates, every two to three months should be fine.  HEPA filters just get dirtier and eventually the fan will have a hard time pulling air through the filter, and the filter should be swapped before that happens.  

=== Can I use any random HEPA filter? ===

This particular box was built around the Klein Tools p100 filter.  Off-brand filters may not be as effective, so be sure that the filter is NIOSH certified.

=== Is the fan box waterproof? ===

No, the fan box is not water proof.  With the weather guard in place, water should not get into the filter directly, but increased humidity could decrease the effectiveness of the device.

=== Any other maintenance tasks? ===

It is important to periodically check that the nuts are tight on the fan box, to ensure that the box is properly sealed against the elements.  Hoses should also be cleaned periodically as well.
