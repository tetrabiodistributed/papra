  How-To guide for building the Tetra PAPRa m12 battery controller (October 2020 version).

== Quick Synopsis

The Tetra Powered Air Purified Respirator requires power to function, and the m12 battery controller provides that power for these models.  The controller consists of internal circuitry, a potentiometer to adjust fan speeds, a cable to connect to the fan box, and a port for a Milwaulkee M12 Battery to be inserted.

If you can build or buy custom circuitboards, then the other version is much more straightforward to assemble.  The plans can be found here: https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/PAPRA-PCB

*WARNING:* we provide no warranty, implicit or explicit, that this device will work up to an N95 specification, when built outside of a facility rated to do so.  The only way to truly test one of these devices using something like a https://tsi.com/products/respirator-fit-testers/portacount-respirator-fit-tester-8038/[Portacount] under controlled conditions.

== Build Steps


You will need these components on hand:

1.  Battery Case ("Controller Body")
2.  Battery lid ("Controller Lid")
3.  Crimper
4.  Needle-nose pliers
5.  Soldering iron/solder/soldering tools
6.  2 red jacketed stranded wire ~2-3 inches (7-10 cm) long
7.  2 black jacketed stranded wire ~2-3 inches (7-10 cm) long
8.  Heat Shrink (to protect wire connections)
9.  2 Male Spade Quick Splice Crimp Terminals
10.  Flush Cutters
11.  Wire stripper
12.  Deburring tool
13.  Philips head screwdriver


### Prepare the wires

#### Cut the wires to size.

To do so, you will need to cut them down to their lengths (our build used ~3 inch/10 cm lengths).  We prepared all six wires (4 stranded and 2 solid) to be basically the same dimensions: ~3 inches/~10 in length, 0.5 cm insulation stripped from both ends.

#### Tin the stranded wires.

#### Crimp a red and black tinned wire each into the spade connectors

### M12 controller circuitry 

#### Snip a portion of the spade connector
A video describing this step:

#### Clean the M12 battery holder spade ports
On the inside of the printed M12 box, there are two slots where the spade connector should fit in.  These slots may have some extra plastic around them due to print quality issues, so use an x-acto knife to clean those slots:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-V6kxqFR/0/1920/i-V6kxqFR-1920.mp4[]

#### Insert the spade connectors into the M12 box
These spade connectors should be inserted with red on the left, black on the right.  The snipped connector should slide in place and prevent the spade connector from coming back out again.

#### Install the board into the M12 box

This video captures the entire process:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-fHTTM3s/0/1920/i-fHTTM3s-1920.mp4[]

Essentially, these steps are followed:

1.  Remove the knob and nut from the control board
2.  Install the power plug into the box
3.  Connect the knob and spade power wires to the board (red to plus, black to minus, spades to DC in and power plug to motor control)
4.  Place the board in the box
5.  Screw the nut and motor control knob onto the board from the outside of the box
6.  Check the connection by turning on the power knob and looking for the red LED on the board to light up
7.  Close access to the circuitboard using the M12 Lid

You may need to deburr the edges of the hole:
