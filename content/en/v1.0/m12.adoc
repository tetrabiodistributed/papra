  How-To guide for building the Tetra PAPRa m12 battery controller (August 2021 version).
aliases:
  - /v1.0/m12
  - /1.0/m12
---

== Quick Synopsis

The Tetra Powered Air Purified Respirator requires power to function, and the m12 battery controller provides that power for these models.  The controller consists of internal circuitry, a potentiometer to adjust fan speeds, a cable to connect to the fan box, and a port for a Milwaulkee M12 Battery to be inserted.

This build differs from the v1 version in that it uses a custom-built circuitboard to remove many of the difficult steps of the build, add a battery charge indicator, and a separate power port for use in a car.  If you cannot get link:../m12-circuit[the custom board], then please refer to the v1 version of this guide.

*WARNING:* we provide no warranty, implicit or explicit, that this device will work up to an N95 specification, when built outside of a facility rated to do so.  The only way to truly test one of these devices using something like a https://tsi.com/products/respirator-fit-testers/portacount-respirator-fit-tester-8038/[Portacount] under controlled conditions.

== Parts Required

This build will require printed parts, purchased parts, and several tools.  Here is a picture of all the components used in this build:

== Build Instructions

Building this version of the controller is more a matter of ensuring that the Controller Box was printed cleanly and all support material is properly removed.  

Attach the light pipe to the board:

You may need to use the bent-nose pliers to get the pipe in place:

Seat the board into the board housing:

Place the washer over the power port, and then finger tighten a hex nut over the same power port to hold the Plate in place:

Place square nuts into the square nut sockets on the battery housing:

Screw in the screws into the board housing to secure the board housing to the battery housing:

Use the bent-nose pliers to attach the nut to the DC jack in the battery housing:

Use the socket wrenches to secure nuts onto the various ports:

Attach the potentiometer printed knob onto the potentiometer knob:

When the battery is in the housing and the potentiometer turned on, a battery life indicator should turn on:
